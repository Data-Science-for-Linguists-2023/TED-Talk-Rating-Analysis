# Final Report: The application of text classification model to the public talk â€“ TED Talk

## Introduction
### Motivation
The motivation for this project is straightforward: since TED talk was one of the main sources I used to learn English, I became curious when I saw a project name titled *What makes a TED talk popular?*. I realized that I, without any solid ground, assumed that it is the content that attracts people and that it is the main source which the speech gains popularity from. Therefore, I intend to discover what the main factor would be that determines the popularity of talks. 

### About the dataset
For this project, I used two datasets which are: [ted_main.csv](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/TED-Talk-Rating-Analysis/blob/main/data_sample/ted_main_sample.csv), [transcript.csv](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/TED-Talk-Rating-Analysis/blob/main/data_sample/transcript_sample.csv). 
### Hypotheses drawn from the datasets


* Motivation of this project
* hypothesis to demonstrate in this project
* Where I got the datasets 
(150~200 words)

## Main Hypothesis: it is possible to predict the popularity of a talk based on its transcript

(350)

## Sub-hypothesis 1: the correlation between the k-band and the rating `obnoxious`
(350)

## Sub-hypothesis 2: the correlatiob between the sentence length and the rating `longwinded`
(350)

## Conclusion
* What I have found
* Future development regarding this data
(200~300)
